# 📜 **Scramble Instructions**
Scramble that gets 1799 words internally from javascript `window` object.

- Letters can be reused. For example, `lesp` gives `spell`.

Penalties:
- -3 for clicking Rack (complete to get new)
- -1 for clicking Back (discourages spamming)

Reveal is free. Maybe I'll make it decrement score for every second it is open.

# Dev Notes
- Splits: camelcase/pascalcase, underscore
- Ignores: numbers, all caps, on-listeners
- Recursion: 3
- Chars: >2

# Purpose
Fun experiment, getting words from thin air 😁
